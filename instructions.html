      There will be 16 tiles that are face down and two tiles are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching tiles, in this case matching colors. This particular memory game is to be played alone and compete for the highest score. The score is calculated after each turn, if you find a match you will be awarded with 1000 pts but if you fail to find a match then 250 pts will be deducted from your total. After you find all the matches, your final score will be compared to the high scores. It is a particularly good game for young children, though adults may find it challenging and stimulating as well.
